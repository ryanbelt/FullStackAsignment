# FullStackAsignment

## Installation
```bash
$ npm install 
```
or
```bash
$ npm install package.json
```
## Compile
used nodeJs as the server and type the following to activate the server.
```bash
$ node node.js
```
default address port will be prot ```5000``` and type index.html to connect 23andMe. eg. ```http://localhost:5000/index.html```

## Configuration
Since ```redirect_uri```, ```client_id```, ```client_secret```, ```scope``` and ```port``` can be frequently change. On this project, I didn't hard code those parameters instead of link them all into the config file.
